Introduction
This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify Yelp reviews into two categories: 1-star (negative) and 5-star (positive) based on the text content. Unlike the more complex approach covered in the lectures, this project leverages the efficiency of pipeline methods for a streamlined classification process.

Dataset
The project utilizes the Yelp Review Dataset sourced from Kaggle. Each record in the dataset represents a review of a business by a specific user.

Key columns:

stars: Review rating (1-5 stars)
text: Text content of the review
cool, useful, funny: Number of votes for the review in respective categories
Project Goal
To build a classification model capable of accurately predicting whether a Yelp review is a 1-star or 5-star review based solely on the text content.
